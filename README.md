## ðŸ’¢Introduction
Covid-19 Statistics based on location- React-Native project. The idea for this application came from a mini project we did about predictions and visualization of the virus at the start of 2020 When covid-19 virus was new and there were no predictions about it. In that application, we used machine learning algorithms to visualize the trends in the covid-19 outbreak in charts and graph formats. Since then the world has changed a lot and tracking the virus become needs time, Hence this app was created to track the daily number of cases, deaths, and recoveries. This app works on the bases of React-Native which is an open source UI software with a JavaScript framework for writing real, natively creating mobile applications for iOS and Android for the data collection part it uses rest AP-I. These types of apps are easy to use and have fast rendering. We can use the react components to render different parts so that we donâ€™t have to render the whole page again, which reduces the load on users' mobile. This app can give you real-time updates on covid-19 based on the location you have selected, also the historical records of that location regarding the covid-19. This app can be very helpful to gain incites about current covid-19 conditions, And also with its user-friendliness, it can be used by anyone who has a smartphone.

## ðŸ’¢Methodology
### various Methods used to develop the Project:
- Java Script and React-Native
- Windows: 10(64 bit), Any processor above i3
- IDE or Editor: Vs-code

### Minimum Software Requirements:
- Operating System: Windows 10
- VsCode: any latest version
- Android studio: Any latest version
- Nodejs: Any latest version

### Minimum Hardware Requirments
- Desktop Computer/ Laptop
- 8 Gb ram(for simulation of mobile)
- The windows 10 is good for fast processing and better performance of the software
- Simulation of android on the computer takes a lot of memory power thatâ€™s why it
  is necessary to have at least 8Gb of RAM.

## ðŸ’¢Implementation
This app includes five screens, as shown in the diagram: 1.splash screen 2.the main
screen 3.Statistics screen 4.display the results of the search Screen 5.About-us Screen.
Each screen has an unique function.
- 1.Splash Screen: We show the applicationâ€™s logo/icon when the user initially starts/launches
    it. This screen only displayed for a specific amount of time, such as 3-4 seconds.
- 2.Homepage: After the splash screen, the user is redirected to the homepage, which
    includes a calling function that redirects to the call a central helpline and a site function
    that, after clicking on a button, redirects to the cowin site function in Chrome.
- 3.Statistics Screen: There are two buttons: global and country (India). The default button is for India, and the user will get statistics and a line chart graph of India. If you
    choose/switch the button to global, it will show information regarding global statistics.
- 4.Search State Screen: Because this app is primarily designed for India, there is a list
    of Indian states. Clients can search for a particular state from the list of states, and after
    selecting a state, the app will display data for just that state. Data such as recovered,
    deaths, and active cases are examples of such information.
- 5.About Screen: This screen contains information about the developer and also the version of the app
